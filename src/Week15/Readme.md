Book a seat: The staff has to enter the theatre number along with the seat information to be booked (which includes the row and the seat numbers). The staff can only book one seat at a time. A confirmation message must be shown, if the booking is successful. A staff should be notified with a different message, if the seat is already taken.

Edit movie title: Minor Cineplexâ€™s current policy is to show the same movie in all of its theatres. Note that this policy may be changed in the future.

View sales report: The sales report must show the movie title, the number of tickets sold in each theatre, the revenue from each theatre. The total number of tickets sold and total revenue from all theatres must also be displayed.
